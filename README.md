# Rideshare-Optimization-Project

This Project is done under the fulfillment of CS255 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Ridesharing services such as Baywheels follow fixed pricing models linked to predefined time intervals, coupled with supplementary charges for exceeding these time limits. Our project focuses on devising an algorithmic solution to minimize cost in long and expensive journeys. 

This involves modeling the transportation network as a graph, where nodes represent stations and edges symbolize travel durations. The objective is to determine the most cost-efficient route within this graph by minimizing additional expenses incurred by exceeding predefined time intervals. 

This will be done by scheduling multiple intermediate rides to stations enroute to the final destination. Our application will support multiple concurrent users, but each user will only be able to schedule only one ride using a single bike at a time. This project aims to deliver a cost-minimization solution tailored to users utilizing BayWheelsâ€™ rideshare services.
